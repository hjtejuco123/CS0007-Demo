Loan Eligibility Checker
	Check if Eligible to get a loan

Requirements:

User Input:

	The program should prompt the user to enter their monthly salary.
	The program should prompt the user to enter their credit score.
	The program should prompt the user to enter their total existing debt.
	The program should prompt the user to enter the desired loan amount.

Eligibility Criteria:

	The user must have a monthly salary of at least $3000.
	The user must have a credit score of 700 or above.
	The total debt, including the requested loan amount, 
        must not exceed 50% of the userâ€™s annual income (i.e., (salary * 12) / 2).
        * 
1  4000    750	5000  20000   "Sorry, you are not eligible for the loan."

* 
*   annual income = (4000 * 12) = 48000
*   Max allowable debt (50%) of 48000 = 24000
*   5000+20000=25000 
* 
Decision Making:

	The program should evaluate the user's input against the eligibility criteria.
	If all criteria are met, the user is eligible for the loan.
	If any criteria are not met, the user is not eligible.

Output:

	Display a message informing the user whether they are eligible for the loan or not.

Error Handling:

	Ensure that all inputs are valid (e.g., numeric values for salary, credit score, debt, and loan amount).
	Handle negative values appropriately, providing feedback to the user.
