Overview of Java I/O

    Javaâ€™s Input and Output operations (Java I/O) are used to process input and 
    generate output efficiently by using the concept of streams. 
    
    The java.io package encapsulates all classes needed for these operations.

Stream Concept: A stream in Java represents a continuous flow of data in the form of bytes, 
    similar to a water stream. Java provides three primary pre-defined streams:
    
    System.out: Standard output stream for console printing.
    System.in: Standard input stream for reading user input.
    System.err: Standard error stream for printing error messages.
